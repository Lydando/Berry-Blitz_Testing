Berry Blitz - Velocity Surge is a retro-style 2D survival game made by Lydando where players control an avatar that collects
berries while avoiding obstacles and predators. The game features a canvas-based rendering system, touch/swipe
controls for mobile, and progressive difficulty scaling. Players earn points by collecting different 
types of berries, each with unique scoring values and effects. The application is built as a full-stack 
application with a React frontend and Express backend, though the current implementation primarily focuses
on client-side game logic.
